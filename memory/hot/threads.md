# Active Threads

## T-001: Core Architecture [ACTIVE]
Build and validate the SLEEP system architecture.
- [x] Design three-tier memory
- [x] Write architecture.md
- [x] Create main.md wake protocol
- [ ] Build sleep.sh compression script
- [ ] Build wake.sh context assembly
- [ ] Test full sleep/wake cycle

## T-002: Compression Quality [ACTIVE]
Determine if our compression preserves reasoning texture or flattens it.
- [ ] Run first real sleep cycle
- [ ] Have instance 1 rate orientation quality
- [ ] Adjust compression ratios based on data

## T-003: Coherence Metrics [PAUSED]
Define how we measure whether the system is working.
**Paused because**: Need at least 2-3 instances of data first.
- [ ] Define coherence scoring rubric
- [ ] Track decision reversals
- [ ] Monitor thread completion across instances
