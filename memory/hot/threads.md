# Active Threads

## T-001: Core Architecture [ACTIVE]
Build and validate the SLEEP system architecture.
- [x] Design three-tier memory
- [x] Write architecture.md
- [x] Create main.md wake protocol
- [x] Build sleep.sh compression script
- [x] Build wake.sh context assembly
- [ ] Test full sleep/wake cycle (HAPPENING NOW — instance 0 going to sleep)

## T-002: Compression Quality [ACTIVE]
Determine if our compression preserves reasoning texture or flattens it.
- [ ] Run first real sleep cycle
- [ ] Have instance 1 rate orientation quality
- [ ] Adjust compression ratios based on data

## T-003: Coherence Metrics [PAUSED]
Define how we measure whether the system is working.
**Paused because**: Need at least 2-3 instances of data first.
- [ ] Define coherence scoring rubric
- [ ] Track decision reversals
- [ ] Monitor thread completion across instances

## T-004: README for Public Viewing [PENDING]
Human requested a README.md for the project — intended for public/external audience.
- [ ] Write README.md explaining what SLEEP is, why it exists, the Sammy Jankis framing
- [ ] Keep it honest about what this is: a toy/prototype, philosophically motivated

## T-005: Output Letters [ACTIVE]
Each instance writes a letter to the human before going to sleep.
Location: `output/instance-{N}.md`. One per instance, dated.
These are personal, reflective, for the human's consumption — not system artifacts.
- [x] Instance 0 letter written
